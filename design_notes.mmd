# Scheme Compiler Notes #


## Garbage Collector ##


 The box address, box type and GC intrinsics should be allocated/kept separate from the actual data in 
 memory, such that GC passes can be more optimal.

## Stack vs Heap Allocation ##


Literals used inside a function's scope can be allocated on the stack with no need for GC if the continuation
is not used elsewhere. Most integer literals can be unboxed completely in this way.


## The macro expander ##

## Code generation ##

## Library functions ##

## Numeric Tower ##

Unlike scheme, we should have bignum & ratio as part of the numeric tower.

## Pure Functions ##

Function signatures should include a pure bit. If the function is referentially pure then it 
is tagged pure, a function can only be referentially pure if it uses only referntially pure functions.
